# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Browser-use exists to solve the challenge of enabling AI agents to interact with web browsers in an intelligent and human-like way. It bridges the gap between language models and web automation by providing a robust framework for AI-driven browser control.

## Problems It Solves

1. Complex Web Automation
   - Traditional automation tools lack intelligent decision making
   - Web interactions often require understanding context and content
   - Dynamic websites need adaptive interaction strategies

2. AI Integration Challenges
   - Connecting LLMs to browser automation
   - Handling visual and textual context
   - Managing state and memory
   - Coordinating multiple actions and decisions

3. Web Interaction Complexity
   - Element selection and interaction
   - Multi-tab management
   - Form handling and validation
   - Dynamic content loading
   - Error recovery

## How It Should Work

1. Simple Interface
   - Easy initialization with LLM model and task
   - Automatic handling of browser setup
   - Clear action execution flow
   - Intuitive error handling

2. Intelligent Decision Making
   - LLM analyzes page content and state
   - Vision capabilities for visual understanding
   - Structured action planning
   - Adaptive error recovery

3. Robust Browser Control
   - Reliable element interaction
   - Session persistence
   - Download management
   - Security features

## User Experience Goals

1. Developer Experience
   - Simple API for common tasks
   - Extensible architecture
   - Clear documentation
   - Example use cases

2. AI Agent Experience
